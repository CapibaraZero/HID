# ESP32 Rubber Ducky(BLE + USB)

This library contains all the functions to use HID easily in ESP-32 S3 and theoretically S2.

We use it in [CapibaraZero fw](https://github.com/CapibaraZero/fw) for the HID attack.

Check example for usage.

Only ESP32-S3 and S2 support USB HID.

ESP32-S2 not support bluetooth.
